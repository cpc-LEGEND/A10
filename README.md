Why Cookies?
When using a website, cookies generated on a webpage are used to track a user’s information. In case a website goes down or the internet connection is disabled, the cookies will hold the user’s information until the problems are fixed. However, some may refrain from using website cookies to track their data because their personal data may be corrupted or hijacked by other third parties. In terms of ethicality, I think it's unethical because there are other ways to store user data, such as localStorage or just saving personal information on a local file
